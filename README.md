# Deep_learning_with_Tensorflow
The exercises and projects for TensorFlow for Deep Learning Bootcamp by ZTM Academy. The notebooks cover topics such as:
1. Regression
2. Binary and Multi-class classification
3. Convolutional Neural Networks
4. Transfer Learning
5. Recurrent Neural Networks
6. Natural Language Processing

# Setup
You need a python environment with jupyter notebook/lab installed. The GPU version of tensorflow is required to run the notebooks efficiently. However, a CPU version should work as well. One could use Google Colab to run the notebooks.
